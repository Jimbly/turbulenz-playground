Place river mouths - on coast where two slope maps are lowest?
  Maybe not?

Next: re-read paper's method of choosing how to expand

For now: Ever coast cell is a potential source
  If someone expands over an unexplored one, that's fine, remove it from potential
  Use rslope to decide where river should expand
Start a second texture, as well as a Uint16 array that we can use for river ordinality
  After expanding rivers, everything should be a river, calculate the strahler number for each, and put that in a texture, draw that? Or, texture needs a direction in each hex and draw a line? Or, we prune rivers, so hexes either are or are not a river at this scale of map?

Calculate drainage basins
Prune rivers and re-calc strahler numbers

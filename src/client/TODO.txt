Combine all elevation into a single scalar, so calculating normal/slope is simple without knowing land/ocean!
  Also, need to tune what kind of values these are - is 256 enough precision?  Probably not for lowlands

Add "relief view" checkbox on humidity that just shows the sexy relief view

Have River byte be 6 neighbors + 2-bit strahler number? (1-5)
  Strahler is pretty trivial to calculate at load-time though

Next steps:
  Add getBiomeType() preview here and see what biomes get generated where
    Based on: tslope, elev, humidity?  Ignore elev for now? some scale slope by elev (but, want mountainous coasts)?
  Export image into game and generate just height (flat biome) for whole world, see what it feels like (just LODs?)
    Also add rivers?


Change tex height to be smaller so total represents a square area?
  Would this make it difficult to map to a megagrid?
  Better for previewing at least, though only slightly faster?
  Later? Allow this to be otherwise rectangular, for varied continent generation?

Tuning factor H: we take the highest priority node within H of the lowest elevation candidate
  Low H -> fill lowlands first
  High H -> fewer, long, windy rivers?

X Prune rivers and re-calc strahler numbers
  Try: do not prune if a connected neighbor's strahler is > 1 (then do not need to re-calc, and provides more interesting shapes?)

X Generate heightmap
  Might be completely invalid, need to see it in 3D
  Maybe need to calculate ridge lines between drainage basins and then work backwards?

For better river basins - we need to adjust the rslope based on the strahler number, and flatten it out at the bottom

Try: do not prune rivers if a connected neighbor's strahler is > 1 (then do not need to re-calc, and provides more interesting shapes?)

Try: Add some chance for rivers to start at non-0 elevation so we get waterfalls into the ocean / lakes
  Or, just some waterfallify process that flattens out choice rivers preceding falling into lakes?

Try: Draw a random river from placed lakes to the ocean, use that to choose base elevation for the lake? How would we fill up to that?

River tuning factor H: we take the highest priority node within H of the lowest elevation candidate
  Low H -> fill lowlands first
  High H -> fewer, long, windy rivers?

For better river basins - we need to adjust the rslope based on the strahler number (and therefore original priority?), and flatten it out at the bottom
  Maybe also adjust tslope coming up from that high-strahler rivers?

Later: Add Uniformish, interesting low-level noise for base sea level elevation on edges (low 25%?) that we can blend to regardless of interior sea level choices
  Have sea level edge and current noise be at 50% of range, so it can go super deep later where needed, and there's not as much dynamic to the near-coastal noise

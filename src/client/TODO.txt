Change tex height to be smaller so total represents a square area?
  Would this make it difficult to map to a megagrid?
  Better for previewing at least, though only slightly faster?
  Later? Allow this to be otherwise rectangular, for varied continent generation?

Tuning factor H: we take the highest priority node within H of the lowest elevation candidate
  Low H -> fill lowlands first
  High H -> fewer, long, windy rivers?

Prune rivers and re-calc strahler numbers

Calculate drainage basins / flag all cells as to which basin they grow out of
Generate heightmap

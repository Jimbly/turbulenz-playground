Get a picture of current biome distribution out at this same scale (256x256 hexomes)


Next steps:
  Export image into game and generate just height (flat biome) for whole world, see what it feels like (just LODs?)
    Also add rivers?


Getting way too much contiguous mountain, yet not enough smaller mountain ranges
  Output is pretty good with 128hx maps, scale mountain_cutoff by 1.5, is_cliff by 2

Change tex height to be smaller so total represents a square area?
  Would this make it difficult to map to a megagrid?
  Better for previewing at least, though only slightly faster?
  Later? Allow this to be otherwise rectangular, for varied continent generation?

Tuning factor H: we take the highest priority node within H of the lowest elevation candidate
  Low H -> fill lowlands first
  High H -> fewer, long, windy rivers?

X Prune rivers and re-calc strahler numbers
  Try: do not prune if a connected neighbor's strahler is > 1 (then do not need to re-calc, and provides more interesting shapes?)

X Generate heightmap
  Might be completely invalid, need to see it in 3D
  Maybe need to calculate ridge lines between drainage basins and then work backwards?

For better river basins - we need to adjust the rslope based on the strahler number, and flatten it out at the bottom

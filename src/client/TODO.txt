Want center of ocean hexome to be just barely under water level usually

Try generating mountains/hills/plains hint for biome type selection (just in playground for now)


Raise water level around lakes
  Can do an efficient fill to determine highest possible level and take some percentage of that?
  How do we communicate this to the game?  Separate water level array?  List of levels and we index into it somehow? List of center points and levels and client does a relatively efficient fill upon load?
  Separate sea level array would RLE compress *really* well - could even RLE compress identical rows


Need to use slope near the coast to decide the initial depth of the ocean next to it, or things interpolate poorly

Add Uniformish, interesting low-level noise for base sea level elevation on edges (low 25%?) that we can blend to regardless of interior sea level choices

Detect perfectly flat islands and do something more interesting - island biome with local gen?
  Or, anything that is elev === 0 but is not a river, should be increased by tslope

Add some chance for rivers to start at non-0 elevation so we get waterfalls into the ocean / lakes

Getting way too much contiguous mountain, yet not enough smaller mountain ranges
  Output is pretty good with 128hx maps, scale mountain_cutoff by 1.5, is_cliff by 2
  Maybe try: place mountain ranges based on drainage basin ridges, irregardless of height?
  Maybe try: adding interior lakes as sinks, and then maybe convert one drainage basin into an outlet to flow to the ocean? Or we draw a random river and use that to calc elevation of the lake and seed our simulation with that?

Change texture height to be smaller so total represents a square area?
  Would this make it difficult to map to a megagrid?
  Better for previewing at least, though only slightly faster?
  Later? Allow this to be otherwise rectangular, for varied continent generation?

Tuning factor H: we take the highest priority node within H of the lowest elevation candidate
  Low H -> fill lowlands first
  High H -> fewer, long, windy rivers?

X Prune rivers and re-calc strahler numbers
  Try: do not prune if a connected neighbor's strahler is > 1 (then do not need to re-calc, and provides more interesting shapes?)

X Generate heightmap
  Might be completely invalid, need to see it in 3D
  Maybe need to calculate ridge lines between drainage basins and then work backwards?

For better river basins - we need to adjust the rslope based on the strahler number, and flatten it out at the bottom
